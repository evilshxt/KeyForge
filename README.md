# ⚡ KeyForge — Modern Typing Speed Challenge

**KeyForge** is a modern, offline-friendly typing speed app built with **React + Vite** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**.  
It helps users improve their typing speed, accuracy, and consistency across multiple challenge modes — all while storing progress and analytics locally in the browser.

> 💡 Everything runs 100% on the client — no backend, no database, no API keys.  
> All stats, scores, and preferences are persisted in **localStorage**.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🧩 Core Modes
1. **Normal Mode** — Type a random paragraph within 60 seconds.  
   - Words-per-minute (WPM) and accuracy are calculated against a fixed passage.
2. **Free-Form Mode** — Type anything you want; accuracy is checked against a built-in dictionary.  
   - Uses a lightweight English word list (optimized `.txt`) loaded lazily for performance.
3. **Monkey Mode** — Random sequence of short words.  
   - Designed for raw speed and character-level precision.

---

### 📊 Analytics Dashboard
- Track historical scores, accuracy, and WPM over time.  
- LocalStorage-based charts and insights (no network requests).  
- Filter stats by mode and session date.  
- See personal bests and average performance.

---

### 🎨 UI / UX
- **Clean Tailwind design** optimized for both desktop and mobile.  
- Real-time feedback:
  - Correct words → ✅ green highlight  
  - Mistyped words → ❌ red highlight  
- Dynamic timer with countdown animation.  
- Dark/Light mode toggle (stored in localStorage).  
- Restart, pause, and reset test easily.  
- Optional loading spinner for free-form dictionary.

---

### 💾 Local-Only Functionality
- **All data stored in browser**:
  - Test results
  - Analytics
  - Preferences (theme, mode, settings)
- **No backend / API / sign-in required**

## 🧠 Core Techniques

| Technique | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Lazy Loading** | The English dictionary (`words.txt`) is fetched only when Free-Form Mode is selected. |
| **Set() Lookup Optimization** | Dictionary words are stored in a JavaScript `Set` for O(1) lookups. |
| **Local Analytics Engine** | Aggregates and stores scores, accuracy, and WPM in localStorage. |
| **Debounced Input Parsing** | Improves performance for real-time character comparison. |
| **Dynamic Rendering** | Components re-render smoothly on mode or theme change. |
